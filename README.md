# Pixel Intellect - An Image Recognition Software

## Introduction

Welcome to my image recognition project repository! This application uses TensorFlow to train a neural network with provided images and is able to identify and categorise an image with an 85% accuracy. Torch is used to flatten pixel arrays in order to be processed by the neural network.

## Installation

To get this project up and running on your local machine, do this:

1. **Open up Git Bash on your machine**
